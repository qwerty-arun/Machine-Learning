   ### Numpy Basics
   - Array Creation
   - Array properties: Shape, Dimension, Size, dtype etc.
   - Special arrays: zeros, ones, eye, arange, linspace etc.
   - Randome arrays
   - Array operations: +, *, **, np.dot(a,b)
   - Indexing and Slicing
   - Reshaping and Transposing
   - Boolean Indexing
   - Aggregation Functions

   ### Beginner Practice Programs
   - Create a 1D array of numbers from 0 to 9.
   - Create a 3x3 matrix with values ranging from 0 to 8.
   - Create a 5x5 identity matrix.
   - Generate a random number between 0 and 1.
   - Create a 10-element array of zeros and set the fifth value to 1.
   ### Intermediate Practice Programs
   - Create a 10x10 array with random values and find the minimum and maximum values.
   - Normalize a 5x5 random matrix (values between 0 and 1).
   - Multiply two matrices (2x3) and (3x4).
   - Replace all odd numbers in an array with -1.
   - Create a checkerboard 8x8 matrix using slicing.
   ### Advanced Programs
   - Find the most frequent value in an array.
   - Write a function that computes the moving average over a 1D array.
   - Rotate a matrix by 90 degrees.
   - Solve a linear system Ax = b using np.linalg.solve().
   - Create a Mandelbrot set using NumPy and matplotlib.
