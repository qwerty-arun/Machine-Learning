   <summary><strong>AI for Everyone Course - by Andrew Ng on Coursera</strong></summary>

## 20/5/25
- ANI, Gen AI and AGI
- Supervised Learning
- How do LLMs work?
- Importance of Cleaning up data before feeding it to system
- ML v/s DS
- What is Deep Learning / Neural Networks?

## 21/5/25
- Starting an AI project: Workflows for ML and DS projects
- Brainstorming Framework: How can businesses use AI to be more efficient
- Build v/s Buy
- Working with an AI team
- Various Libraris/Tools: PyTorch, TensorFlow, HuggingFace, Paddle Paddle, Scikit-Learn, R, Research Pubilication on arxiv, Repos: Github
- Building AI in your company: Case Studies for Smart Speackers and Self-Driving Cars
- Different Roles for AI: Software Engineer, ML Engineer, ML Researcher, Data Scientist, Data Engineer, AI Product Manager
- AlexNet and its papers

## 22/5/25
- Execute Pilot Projcts: more important for initial projects to succeed rather than be most valuable
- Show traction within 6-12 months
- Who is CAIO: Chief AI Officer looks upon the in-house AI team which develops solutions for other business units
- Providing AI training for executives, senior business leaders, leaders of divitions and trainees too is very important
- Better Product -> More Users -> More Data -> Better Product and the cycle continues
- Don't be too optimistic or pessimistic about AI. It can't solve everything? At the same time, it can create great impact for very specific applications
- Get some friends to learn about AI
- Start brainstorming projects with them: No project is too small to start
- Areas of Impact: Computer Vision, NLP, Speech, Generative AI, Robotics, General ML, Unsupervised Learning, Transfer Learning, Reinforcement Learning, GAN, Knowledge graphs etc.
- Limitations of AI: Biases, performance issues, adversarial attacks, deepfakes etc.

  <summary><strong>How I use LLMs by Andrew Karpathy on YT</strong></summary>

  # [How I use LLMs -by Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw)
  ## 23/5/25
  - User input -> LLM like ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) -> Output
  - Basically LLMs predict the next works in a sentence as we type.
  - How user input is divided into tokens? Use [Tiktokenizer](https://tiktokenizer.vercel.app/) to actually what's happening under the hood.
  - What is context window? It is like the working memory.
  - LLMs are usually out of date by a few months.
  - For every 1TB data trained on LLM, there will be trillions of parameters that can be fine tuned.
  - What is pre-training and what is post-training?

  ### Extra
  - I learnt about OpenAI's API keys. I will use them sooner of later.

  ## 24/5/25
  - In reinforcement learning, model discovers thinking strategies that leads to good outcomes.
  - Research Paper: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement learning.
  - All models of GPT like o1, o3-mini, o3-mini-high, 03-pro etc are "thinking" models.
  - If you want to do more complex tasks in math and coding, try "reasoning / thinking" models.
  - How does internet search work? This tool has the power to insert tokens into our context window.
  - Models can switch anytime to "web search" even if you don't specify it.
  - "Deep Research" is a combination of Internet Search and Thinking.
  - Try asking different models aobut recent news.

  ## 25/5/25
  ### Uploading documents feature
  - It may discard images
  - If present, it will not be well understood
  - Under the hood:
   ```mermaid
flowchart LR;
A[PDF]-->B[Text/Tokens];
B-->C[Context Window];
   ```
  - Use LLMs to read books faster and clearer
  ### Python Interpreter
  - For calculating big multiplications, GPT uses a Python interpreter, write code, calculates the answer, converts it to text and puts it in the context window.
  - Some other LLMs may not use code, it can directly do it using its brain. But, it may be wrong!

    ### Advanced Data Analysis
    - Ask GPT OpenAI valuation throughout the years in the form of table, then ask it to create graphs.
    - Also, this can be wrong! You need to dig a little bit.
    - But, it is actually powerful.
    ### Claud: Artifacts, Apps and Diagrams
    - Create 20 flashcards from a text
    - Tell it to create an quiz app for the flashcards. It basically adds UI to it
    - You can create mindmaps if you are a visual learner. It uses the Mermaid library. Same thing which I used above.
    ## Cursor - AI
    - You just have to give some prompts. The rest, it will take care. The composer will generate the code.
    - In chat, you can ask to explain a specific chunk of code to be explained.
