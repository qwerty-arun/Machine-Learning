   <summary><strong>AI for Everyone Course - by Andrew Ng on Coursera</strong></summary>

## 20/5/25
- ANI, Gen AI and AGI
- Supervised Learning
- How do LLMs work?
- Importance of Cleaning up data before feeding it to system
- ML v/s DS
- What is Deep Learning / Neural Networks?

## 21/5/25
- Starting an AI project: Workflows for ML and DS projects
- Brainstorming Framework: How can businesses use AI to be more efficient
- Build v/s Buy
- Working with an AI team
- Various Libraris/Tools: PyTorch, TensorFlow, HuggingFace, Paddle Paddle, Scikit-Learn, R, Research Pubilication on arxiv, Repos: Github
- Building AI in your company: Case Studies for Smart Speackers and Self-Driving Cars
- Different Roles for AI: Software Engineer, ML Engineer, ML Researcher, Data Scientist, Data Engineer, AI Product Manager
- AlexNet and its papers

## 22/5/25
- Execute Pilot Projcts: more important for initial projects to succeed rather than be most valuable
- Show traction within 6-12 months
- Who is CAIO: Chief AI Officer looks upon the in-house AI team which develops solutions for other business units
- Providing AI training for executives, senior business leaders, leaders of divitions and trainees too is very important
- Better Product -> More Users -> More Data -> Better Product and the cycle continues
- Don't be too optimistic or pessimistic about AI. It can't solve everything? At the same time, it can create great impact for very specific applications
- Get some friends to learn about AI
- Start brainstorming projects with them: No project is too small to start
- Areas of Impact: Computer Vision, NLP, Speech, Generative AI, Robotics, General ML, Unsupervised Learning, Transfer Learning, Reinforcement Learning, GAN, Knowledge graphs etc.
- Limitations of AI: Biases, performance issues, adversarial attacks, deepfakes etc.

   <summary><strong>Python</strong></summary>

   # 26/5/25
   - Learnt basic arithmetic
   - Learnt basic syntax
   - True, False, bool(), None, is, ==, difference between `is` and `==`, chainin relational operators
   - Strings and their basics, f-strings
   ## How to actually learn python fast?
   - Week 1-2: Master the basics
   - Week 3-4: Write at least 30-40 programs
   - Never fall into "tutorial hell". When watching 70-80% of content, you actually only retain 10-20%.
   - Focus on 80-90% doing and only 20% tutorials.
   - Pick a Niche: Web Dev (Django, Flask, Fast API), Game Dev (Pygame), Data Analysis (Pandas, Numpy), Machine Learning (PyTorch, Tensorflow), Working with AI agents (LangChain, LangGraph), Automation scripts for daily tasks and Hardware Projects (Raspberry Pi).
   - After picking your niche, pick a project to work on.
   - Finish the damn project! Even if it is bad!
   - Advanced Python: List comprehensions, Generator expressions, Context managers, Dictionary and Set Operations, Decorators, Type Hints
   - Version Control your code properly
   - Deploy your projects: Web apps (Heroku, Railway or Render), Data Projects (Google Colab, Kaggle), Utilities (Docker)

   # 27/5/25
   - Wrote some basic programs: Odd/Even, Leap Year, Sum of Digits, Armstrong no., Prime no.s in a range, Print triangle patterns, Number Reversal, Fibonacci sequence, Remove duplicate characters in a string
   - Learnt about string functions in python
   - Learnt some tips and tricks along the way

   # 28/5/25
   - Wrote Some more programs: calculator, number guessing, password strength checker, capitalize first letter of each word in a sentence, word frequency in a sentence etc.
   - Learnt new concepts: functions, some cool operations on lists and even strings
   - There are crazy functions out there!!
   ## General
   - Applied for "AI essentials" course on Coursera. Seems worth it.
   - Revised some previous AI learnings, python syntax etc.

   ## 31/5/25
   - Wrote around 6-7 programs
   - Transpose problem, flatten lists, divide the list into chunks, merge sorted lists into one, anagram strings, removing palindrome strings from sentence, reverse each word in strings.
   - Learnt about tuples and dictionaries and basic operations
   - Searched about projects which I can do using python. There are so many options!
